## Who are we?
We GDC Dottopus, located at Istinye University are a club that focuses on making game jams, game nights and more events possible, to make game-dev popular at Turkiye.

## What is this bot?
This bot -could be my best project yet- is for our discord server, [GDC Dottopus](https://discord.gg/P5QyF7NFxh), for the purpose of helping our staff out to get them to be more efficient via the usage of the bot and the systems given.\
I would like to remind that the code is still owned by me and the GDC Dottopus squad, do not use without proper permissions and proper ...

## Can I use this bot in my discord server?
You can, but do not forget that this bot is **hard-coded** to suit GDC Dottopus server, so there might be bugs ocurring left and right. I am thinking about making a web-application for usage of this bot but time will show us if we need this or not.\
Use [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1404577419171729508) to generate a invite to DotBot.

## How can I install this bot?

Simple. Download raw files and run ` pip install -r requirements.txt ` and create a .env file in the file location.\
You need a one liner. Quite literally. After creating a .env file, fill it with:
```dotenv
TOKEN = <your token here>
```
After the creation of .env, you can simply run ` python main.py ` to start the bot. The bot will launch and commands -if not related to a channel- will work. Hopefully.

## I found bugs, where can I send them?
Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/outraft/dotbot/issues) to report bugs, or contact me personally via the GDC Discord, or open a bug ticket via GDC Discord Ticket Channel.

## What channels/roles are hard coded?
If you **really** want to use this bot, you need:
1. event-announcements text channel,
2. role-chat text channel,
3. alerts text channel (i'd recommend using this anyway to set discord's community settings.)
4. ticket text channel
5. welcome text channel
6. ∘ Artist ∘ role
7. ∘ Coder ∘ role
8. ∘ Game Night ∘ role
9. ∘ Jammer ∘ role
